    'name': 'Supervisor Stefani',
    'position': ""Supervisor Stefani's top priorities include: Gun control An ardent supporter of common-sense gun control, Stefani has repeatedlypointed outthat we can do more to 'take guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves or others.' Stefani sponsored legislation proposing a ban on ghost guns in San Francisco, the first of its kind in California. Ghost guns are firearms that can be purchased in individual pieces online and assembled at home, bypassing background check requirements - a workaround thatStefani called a 'massive loophole.'After Stefani's legislation passed in San Francisco, the initiative spread and became a statewide ban. Stefani was also a leader in the local chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, and continues to work with the organization. Public safety and policing Stefani, who chairs the Board of Supervisors' Public Safety and Neighborhood Services Committee, has prioritized adequately staffing the San Francisco Police Department. To address growing staffing shortfalls, she joined 9 other supervisors in April to increase police salaries. Stefani meets regularly with SFPD and publicly supports their efforts, andhas told the Chroniclethat her constituents are begging for more police. Nonprofit oversight and accountability San Francisco has outsourced many key government functions to nonprofit groups, leading to repeated problems withcorruption,mismanagement, andwaste. After the city Controller's Office publishedan auditthat called out problems with how nonprofits' success is measured, Stefaniasked the City Attorney's officeto prepare legislation to standardize success and performance metrics. Stefani has also led the Board of Supervisors in investigating theft and corruption by nonprofits,noting her 'serious concerns'with how the city manages its nonprofit contracts. Supporting small businesses 'For me, small businesses just really represent the fabric of who we are in San Francisco,' Stefanihas said. In the midst of COVID pandemic lockdowns, Stefani tackled what she called 'impediments'' to small businesses staying afloat. These efforts included co-sponsoring theShared Spaces Program(restaurant parklets) andauthoring legislationto reduce fees for small businesses, stating that the city needs to 'stop viewing small businesses as ATMs.' Affordable housing Stefani is a proponent of increasing housing for people of all income levels, including improving city policies tomaximize production of affordable housing. As discussed below, she has repeatedly followed through with key votes in favor of housing, and to help projects succeed despite opposition."",

dean-preston,"{
    'name': 'Supervisor Preston',
    'position': ""Here's where Supervisor Preston stands on the issues:: Against Homebuilding Preston has routinely blocked, opposed, or delayed new home construction, including both market-rate developments and subsidized units. As a rule of thumb, he supports housing only if it is built by government, controlled by government, and subject to rent control. He will oppose other housing, although his stated reasons for opposition change depending on the project. For example, Preston has opposed homebuilding on subjective aesthetic grounds, claiming a project was too big and too modern for his 'intimate, historic neighborhood.' He has also demanded that home builders market50% of units at below-market 'affordable' prices—a figure that would make projects infeasible to build. He delayed upzoning a transit-rich area in his district to conduct a 'race and equity study' thatnever happened. And he fought the construction of newsubsidized, affordablehomes by opposing UCSF's plan to build workforce housing by arguingboththat the proposal wasn't big enough (didn't include enough housing) and that it was so big that it would have an undue impact on the area. Along with opposing individual homebuilding projects, Preston also opposes structural changes to local and state law that would make it easier to build new homes. For example, hecampaigned againsta ballot initiative to speed up affordable housing production andopposeda state bill designed to build more homes in transit-rich neighborhoods. After the city failed to meet state housing targets—in part because of his obstruction—Preston called efforts to impose state-level oversight on San Francisco's housing crisis 'absurd.' Taxation of Real Estate Preston has proposed addressing San Francisco's housing shortage by raising taxes on development—an approach that actually discourages new construction by making it more expensive. For example, he championed a newvacancy taxon unrented units, and spearheaded Proposition I (whichdoubled the transfer taxon certain real estate transactions).  Describing his philosophy, he hasstatedthat he sees higher taxes as a tool to 'address the coming wave of real estate speculation.' Public Safety Preston hasdescribedhimself as a 'strong advocate for defunding the police,' with an ultimate goal of 'prison abolition.' He was a vocal cheerleader for recalled 'progressive' district attorney Chesa Boudin, calling the recall 'idiotic' and a 'gross, racist campaign.' After acomfortable majorityof voters recalled Boudin, Preston doubled down and was theonly sitting supervisorto endorse John Hamasaki—another progressive DA candidate, whosupported defundingthe police andsuggestedpolice shouldn't confiscate guns from teenagers, who he thought might need guns for self-defense. In office, Preston has prioritized minimal policing over addressing public safety concerns. As the representative for the Tenderloin—a neighborhoodplaguedby drug abuse, tent encampments, property crime, and violence—Preston hasopposedthe Mayor's efforts to ramp up policing and enforcement, instead pushing for community ambassadors and street intervention teams. He has similarly resisted policing of property crimes. Whilerunning for officein 2019, he suggested that instead of using police to deter car break-ins, the city could have unarmed city employees intervene in thefts and justask thieves to stop. After car break-insworsenedduring his time in office, he suggested the city address the problem bytelling visitorsnot to leave anything in their cars. Open-Air Drug Dealing and Use Preston has been a vocal opponent of Mayor Breed's efforts to crack down on open air drug use, saying he was 'deeply disappointed and outraged,' and that 'arresting drug users won't help people.' Instead, Preston supportssafe consumption sitesto prevent overdoses; he's also called for 'destigmatizing addiction' as a way to reduce overdose deaths on our streets. Preston's tolerance for open-air drug dealing and drug abuse has frustrated his constituents; for example, the Tenderloin Business Coalition hascriticized himfor failing to support efforts to shut down the open air drug markets that have taken over the neighborhood, and a poll by GrowSF found that93% of San Franciscans want dealers arrested, and 69% even support arresting users. Streets and Transit Preston has worked to improve public transit, walkability, and bicycle infrastructure in San Francisco. HesupportedCar-Free JFK, which closed portions of Golden Gate Park off from cars;lobbiedGovernor Newsom and the state legislature to support the Bay Area's cash-strapped transit agencies; and, as a daily transit user,campaigned ona 'Muni Riders Bill of Rights.' However, his support for transit is sometimes hindered by a lack of practicality. For example, he has pushed for the city's MUNI system to beentirely free, which wasopposed by MUNI agency leadersalready caught betweena looming budget deficitand theirstruggle to restore full service. Research suggests thata free MUNI pilot program would be largely ineffective without a stronger recovery in the downtown area, but it would deprive MUNI of hundreds of millions dollars in needed revenue, potentially resulting in service cuts. Preston's proposal to run a free MUNI pilot was ultimatelyvetoed by Mayor Breed. When it comes to pedestrian safety, Preston can be an aggressive advocate: he recently called for San Francisco to banright turns at red lightscity-wide. But he's a vocal opponent of San Francisco's program to test out driverless vehicles,calling it'irresponsible & reckless.' Based on years of test data across millions of miles, driverless cars appear to besignificantly saferthan human drivers."",

hillary-ronen,"{
    'name': 'Supervisor Ronen',
    'position': ""Here's where Supervisor Ronen stands on the issues: Street Homelessness Ronen chairs the Board of Supervisorscommitteeon homelessness, where she has overseen the city's unsuccessful efforts to reduce its unhoused population. The city's approach has been widely criticized for spending heavily, with few results. For example, in October 2023 Ronen's committee approved 'the most expensive homeless response ever,' paying$140,000 annually per vehicleto have RVs park in an empty lot. Ronen's jurisdiction includes the Mission district, which contains many homeless encampments. Ronen supported building 'tiny cabins' as a partial solution, butretreatedand said the plan might beoff the tableafter a community meeting where neighbors objected to housing homeless people nearby--even though she was 'clearly exasperated' and called the neighbor objections 'a NIMBY thing.' The cabinsmay stillbe built in her district, despite Ronen's inconsistent support. Public Safety Ronen is a frequent critic of the SFPD, although her critiques have shifted over time. In 2020, she was a leading proponent of defunding the police in San Francisco,saying: 'I want to make it clear that I believe strongly in defunding the police and reducing the number of officers on our force.' But by 2023, Ronenreversed courseand began criticizing the SFPD for not providing enough police officers: 'I've been begging this department to give the Mission what it deserves in terms of police presence, all year long. And I've been told time and time and time and time again there are no officers that we can send to Mission.' Ronen is a close ally and supporter of San Francisco's former district attorney, Chesa Boudin, who voters recalled from office in 2022. She endorsed him andraised fundsfor his campaign; opposed the recall andblamedSan Francisco's crime problems on the police force; and spoke out defiantly on the night Boudin was recalled, blaming 'billionaires' anddeclaring: 'We are not done tonight or ever, fighting our system of injustice in the United States.' Like Boudin, Ronen opposes prosecution of sex work, and has introduced legislation tolegalize prostitutionin San Francisco. Opposing Housing Development and Advocating for Price Controls Ronen has repeatedly voted to block housing development, arguing that homes are undesirable 'luxury housing' unless they're subject to price controls or rent limits. For example, in 2018, Ronenblockedthe construction of a 75-unit building on the site of a laundromat; in 2021, she joined anti-housing supervisors inblocking495 homes at the site of a Nordstrom valet parking lot; and in 2023, sheblockedconversion of a single-family home into 10 units. In opposing rules that would streamline housing production, sheexplainedher philosophy: 'I don't believe that increasing the supply of luxury housing will trickle down... It's never going to happen.' Transit An avid walker, Ronenbelievesin making SF's communities 'walkable, bikeable, and transit-oriented.' She has supported public transportation when it's practical and, in some cases, even when it's less so. For example, sheadvocated forthe 'Free Muni' program, which would have piloted making bus and light rail travel free in San Francisco. The programwas opposed bythe head of San Francisco's transit authority, who pointed out that it could overwhelm a system that was trying to recover from low ridership during the COVID-19 pandemic. Reports suggested that the transit authority was alsoconcernedthat the city's buses would become 'rolling homeless shelters,' leading to a 'Muni Death Spiral.' The Free Muni pilot was passed by the Board of Supervisors before beingvetoedby Mayor London Breed."",

Asshe put it, she 'support[s]disbanding the SFPD and requiring officers to reapply to a newly constructed, less violent police force.' Melgaropposedrecalling former DA Chesa Boudin. And like Boudin, she has opposed cracking down on fentanyl dealing and open-air drug abuse on the city's streets. Sharing her perspective, she told the SF Chronicle thatshe doesn't view drug tourism as a concern: 'People have come to San Francisco to do drugs always. This is not new.' She expressed concern with overdose deaths, but also worried that enforcing drug laws is 'criminalizing people.' Melgar has been particularly focused on protecting drug dealers who enter the country illegally. As the Chroniclereported in extensive detail, many dealers are undocumented immigrants from Honduras who come here specifically to sell drugs on our streets. They can't be deported because San Francisco is a sanctuary city (i.e., the city doesn't cooperate with federal immigration authorities). And they exploit a California law that allows defendants to claim they were 'trafficked': dealers haverepeatedly escaped convictionby arguing that they were under the control of coyotes or cartels, so they shouldn't be held responsible for their actions. Supervisor Dorsey proposed addressing this by creating an exception to the city's sanctuary laws that would allow fentanyl dealers to be deported. Melgar voted against the proposal, which shecompared to Nazi Germany and called 'totally counter to our San Francisco values.'She thenled a protestagainst the proposal on the steps of City Hall. Housing Melgarcampaignedas a pro-housing candidate, and housing advocates hoped that she would use her experience as a leader in the city's Department of Building Inspections and Planning Department to combat the city's housing shortage. Unfortunately, she has repeatedly voted to block housing, including a controversial vote to block 495 units ofhousing on a valet parking lot(24% of which would have been 'affordable' housing priced below market rates), and a vote to blockconverting a single-family homeinto 10 units, among others. On the positive side, she has supported measures to make it easier for homeowners to build accessory dwelling units, and has proposed allowing the division of certain large homes in her neighborhood into smaller units. Transportation Melgar has identified transportation as one of her top priorities, and has generally voted in favor of public transportation. Shesupportedkeeping JFK Drive car-free and reportedlybikes to work. But she also favors drivers over pedestrians and cyclists at times; for example, sheopposedextending the Great Highway's closure to cars on weekends. Homelessness Melgar identifies homelessness as a top priority, but she has not been a leader on homeless issues or proposed meaningful fixes to the problem. Homelessness hasgrown in her districtsince she took office (despitefalling in SFas a whole). Promotion of progressive candidates Melgar has promised to prioritize voting for 'the most progressive candidate always,' as long as the candidate also meets her racial and gender requirements. She has carried this out in office, nominating far-left supervisors Shamann Walton and Connie Chan for Board of Supervisors President, and opposing the recalls of far-left officials Alison Collins and Gabriela Lopez (who were recalled from the SF School Board) and Chesa Boudin (who was recalled as SF District Attorney). In choosing what candidates to support for public office, Melgar has promised to prioritize a candidate's race and gender above other considerations, including what those candidates actually believe. In awritten statementseeking the endorsement of a local political club, she described her 'system for endorsements': I will support the most progressive candidate always, except if that candidate is a cis hetero white man, in which case I will instead support in this order, the most progressive:Black manBlack womanPerson of ColorGay personWomanIf a cis hetero white progressive man is running against any of the above or a white cis hetero woman, I will make no endorsement."",

    'position': ""Here's where Supervisor Mandelman stands on the issues: Mental Health & Homelessness Mandelman has witnessed the mental health and homelessness crisis firsthand throughhis mother, who suffered with both, shaping his views on state-sponsored interventions and conservatorship. In early 2020, shortly before the pandemic began, Mandelman and Mayor Breed announced that the cityacquiredtwo mental health facilities, in NoPa and the Mission. Mandelman has called for more court-ordered mental health treatment,noting: 'There are unhoused people who simply need a home, and then there are people who really need more than that. We need to do a better job as a county of trying to make all of those levels of care available. But we also need to be pushing on the state to help fund that.' Although the city implemented a statepilot programin 2019, by early 2022only two peoplehad been placed under conservatorship. Mandelman has also advocated for moving people from tent encampments to city-provided shelter (in contrast to the city's typical approach of leaving people in tents until they receive 'permanent supportive housing'). Calling the current homelessness experience 'inhumane' and 'irrational,' in early 2022, Mandelman introduced his'A Place for All' initiative, requiring the city to provide shelter to everyone willing to accept it. He alsosupports effortsto clarify that those who refuse shelter cannot be considered 'involuntarily homeless,' which would allow the city to remove their tents from public spaces. The city's encampments,he said, 'are dangerous for the people who are in them and terrible for the people who are trying to live and work in those neighborhoods . . . . We have hundreds of people a year dying of overdoses.' Housing Mandelman claims to be a 'pro-housing voice,' andcampaigned on'address[ing]the housing crisis,' but has repeatedly voted to block housing in San Francisco. He voted to block building housing on aNordstrom valet parking lot, which included 24% affordable units, and voted againstconverting a single-family homeinto 10 units. He joined arguably San Francisco's most anti-housing supervisor, Aaron Peskin, in sponsoring legislation that--had it not failed--could havedisastrously limitedhousing development. After a host of officials and builders came out against the 'terrifying' legislation, even Peskin acknowledged that the proposal was a failure. Mandelman alsoopposedSB50, Senator Wiener's proposal to increase housing density in areas around public transit stops. Mandelman did try to support housing production with atwo-part proposalto both legalize building multi-unit fourplexes and to make it harder to build large single-family homes--the idea being to promote more small units, which would be more affordable. But other supervisors amended and watered down the bill and Mayor Breed eventuallyvetoedit, stating that in its final form it would interfere with a pro-housing state law and actually hurt housing production. Public Safety Mandleman has been a moderating voice on public safety issues, resisting the Board of Supervisors's most extreme anti-law-enforcement tendencies. He wasa relative voice of reasonduring the board's effort to defund the police in 2020, pushing back on supervisors who wanted to cancel all police academy classes and slash police overtime. Similarly, when Supervisor Peskin passed legislation to limit the SFPD from using surveillance technologies, Mandelmanscrutinizedthe measure and, after it passed,supported different legislationthat re-authorized some use of surveillance cameras. Mandelmandeclined to take a public positionon the recall of former District Attorney Chesa Boudin, butpersonally votedin favor of the recall and endorsed Brooke Jenkins,the strongest candidate and the only real prosecutor running for DA, to succeed Boudin. In May 2023,Mandelman called out SFPD'slow rates of traffic citations, contributing to the city failing to meet the goals of Vision Zero that were set almost 10 years ago. 'Our streets are as deadly as ever,' he said, calling for SFPD to restore enforcement to at least the same levels as 2014.

As a member of the Board of Education from 2014-2019 (andpresidentfrom 2017-2019), Walton had a hand in creating many of the problems that plague the city's public schools today. For example, during Walton's presidency the BOE launched itsdisastrous projectto select a new payroll system, which failed to pay teachers correctly and ran dramatically over budget. As BOE president, and later as a supervisor, he helped his ideological allies control the city's educational policy. He endorsedAlison CollinsandFaauuga Moligafor the BOE (two of the three failed school board members who voters later recalledby overwhelming margins). Heopposedthe recalls. After the recalls succeeded he doubled down,endorsing Gabriela López--the third recalled board member, and the only one that ran again after being recalled. López lost her bid to rejoin the boardby a large margin, despite Walton's endorsement. Walton has advocated for stripping merit-based admission from Lowell (San Francisco's flagship high school),callingthe school's grades-based admissions criteria 'a racist policy' and opining that 'it's unfathomable' that people would want one of SF's schools to focus on high-achieving students (instead of admitting students through a lottery like the city's other public schools). Public Safety Walton has been anoutspoken advocatefor defunding the police. In 2020, hepartneredwith the mayor's office 'to reinvest $120 million . . . from law enforcement into San Francisco's Black and African-American community.' While he was successful in redirecting funds, the mayorlaterdirected other funds to the police force to avoid cutting officers. Walton was also a passionate defender of former district attorney Chesa Boudin. He opposed giving voters an opportunity to recall Boudin for his refusal to enforce criminal laws,opiningthat 'it is extremely dangerous to use recalls strictly because you don't agree with someone's views.' Faced with the recalls of his allies on the BOE and in the DA's office, Waltontriedto limit voter's ability to recall future officials, but votersrejectedhis attempt. Walton has also worked toshutter the city's juvenile hall. Housing Walton consistently votes against new housing in San Francisco, claiming that new housing causes displacement (despiteevidencethat new housing 'actually benefits incumbent tenants by reducing rents, evictions, and the risk of moves to poorer zipcodes').
