Create a high level project structure for a langchain agent to operate on city planning code.

Process Flow:
Scraping:
- Scrape title/date/vote from https://sfgov.legistar.com/PersonDetail.aspx?ID=36652&GUID=14EFBAA7-E930-4706-BF21-399C01B1F1F6&Search=)[https://sfgov.legistar.com](https://sfgov.legistar.com)
- Resolutions: https://sfbos.org/resolutions-2023
- Data API: https://dev.socrata.com/
- Export into psql database

Processing:

- Run LLM on combined fields and create summary table
- Assign/calc reliability rating
- Add vertical label
- Extract concrete outcomes (investment, impact, etc)

Frontend:

- Timeline of bills past/present/future
- City statistics by vertical
- Summary page per politician


Deployment Stack: Local machine
- Scrape + local DB
- LLM on combined fields, OpenAI calls


Stack flow to test:
- Generalized way of loading data. Organize code ahead of time. Interfaces for new scraper objects
- Processing methods code
- Export scripts to capture plotly chart generation.
